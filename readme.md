# Industrial IoT Simulator on Kathar√°

This project ports the original [Industrial IoT Simulator](https://github.com/fillol/IIoT-simulator) to run within the [Kathar√°](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara) network simulation environment. It allows simulating an Industrial IoT (IIoT) setup using Docker containers orchestrated by Kathar√°, providing a flexible platform for testing network interactions, security postures, and data flow patterns in complex IIoT scenarios.

## üìú How it Works
This simulator emulates three production lines (pressing, welding, painting) with virtual sensors compliant with Industry 4.0 standards. It generates realistic data (vibration, temperature, quality) transmitted via MQTT over a Kathar√°-managed network to a central control center with predictive alert logic.

### Key Features (Inherited from original):
* **Realistic Sensor Data**: Vibration (ISO 10816 principles), Temperature (ISO 13732 principles), Quality Control metrics.
* **MQTT Communication**: Configurable QoS levels, payload sizes, and frequencies.
* **Modular Design**: Separate containers for production lines, MQTT broker, and control center.
* **Dynamic Configuration**: Sensor behavior defined in JSON files, decoupled from Python logic.

### Kathar√° Adaptation:
* Uses Kathar√° for network topology definition and container orchestration (`lab.conf`, `.startup` files).
* Allows for complex network setups (routers, different subnets) managed by Kathar√°.
* Provides interactive shells into each component via Kathar√°.

## üöÄ Usage

### Prerequisites
* [Kathar√°](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara) installed.
* Docker and Docker Compose (used for building images).
* Python 3.10+ (Optional: for potential local script testing).

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fillol/IIoT-sim-on-Kathara.git
    cd IIoT-sim-on-Kathara
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker Images:**
    Navigate to the repository's root directory. The Docker services are defined in `src/compose.yml`.
    ```bash
    # Build all images defined in the compose file within the src directory
    docker compose -f src/compose.yml build
    ```

3.  **Launch the Kathar√° Lab:**
    Use the `lstart` command to start the network simulation environment defined in `lab.conf`.
    *Important:* This often requires `sudo` permissions.
    ```bash
    sudo kathara lstart
    ```
    This command will:
    * Read `lab.conf` to understand the network topology and devices (p1, p2, p3, cc, mqtt, rtr).
    * Start Docker containers for each device.
    * Execute the corresponding `.startup` scripts within each container.
    * Open terminal windows connected to each running container (p1, p2, p3, cc, mqtt, rtr).

4.  **Monitor the Simulation:**
    * **Kathar√° Terminals**: The terminals opened by `Kathara lstart` provide direct shell access. However, due to the `entrypoint.sh` workaround (see notes below), the main Python scripts might not output directly to these terminals initially.
    * **Docker Logs**: The primary way to see the simulator's output (sensor data, control center messages) is via `docker logs`. The container names are typically defined in `lab.conf` (e.g., `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `cc`, `mqtt`).
        ```bash
        # Example: View logs for production line 1 and the control center
        docker logs -f p1
        docker logs -f cc
        ```
    * **Manual Execution (If Needed)**: Sometimes, the main scripts might not start automatically within the Kathar√° environment. If you don't see output in `docker logs` after a short while, you may need to manually start them in the respective Kathar√° terminals:
        * In the `p1` terminal: `python main.py`
        * In the `p2` terminal: `python main.py`
        * In the `p3` terminal: `python main.py`
        * In the `cc` terminal: `python main.py`
        (The `mqtt` broker and `rtr` usually don't require manual intervention if their startup scripts are configured correctly).

### Kathar√° Specific Notes:
* **Entrypoint Workaround**: Each service (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `cc`) uses an `entrypoint.sh` that typically launches `/bin/bash`. This keeps the container running and prevents Kathar√° from potentially terminating it immediately after the main process (like `python main.py`) might finish or if started as a background task within the `.startup` script. The actual application (`python main.py`) is intended to be launched by the `.startup` script or manually.
* **Startup Reliability**: Script execution via `.startup` can sometimes be inconsistent depending on timing or environment factors within Kathar√°. Manual execution or checking `docker logs` is often necessary.

## üîç Composition:

### üê≥ Key Actors:

#### 1. Production Lines (p1, p2, p3)
* **Implementation:** Python scripts (`src/publisherX/main.py`) using sensor classes (`src/publisherX/sensors/`).
* **Configuration:** Defined in JSON files (`src/publisherX/lineX.json`). Example (`src/publisher1/line1.json`):
    ```json
    {
      "line_id": "PRESS-LINE-1",
      "sensors": [
        {
          "type": "vibration",
          "interval": 0.5,
          "payload": "small",
          "qos": 2
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
* **Data Generation:** Simulates Vibration, Temperature, and Quality sensors based on industrial standards.

#### 2. Control Center (cc)
* **Subscription:** Monitors MQTT topics (e.g., `factory/#`). Logic in `src/control-center/main.py`.
* **Alert Logic:** Processes incoming data and triggers alerts based on predefined rules.

#### 3. MQTT Broker (mqtt)
* Typically the standard `eclipse-mosquitto` image, configured via `mqtt.startup` or a custom config file mounted by Kathar√°. Handles message queuing and delivery.

#### 4. Router (rtr)
* A simple container (e.g., based on Alpine or FRR) configured by Kathar√° (`rtr.startup`) to route traffic between different network segments defined in `lab.conf`.

### üì¶ Payload Strategy

| Category   | Size          | Frequency | Use Case             | Example Line   |
| :--------- | :------------ | :-------- | :------------------- | :------------- |
| **Small**  | 1-10 KB       | 0.5-2 sec | Real-time monitoring | PRESS-LINE-1   |
| **Medium** | 10-100 KB     | 2-5 sec   | Historical trends    | WELDING-LINE-2 |
| **Large**  | 100 KB - 1 MB | 5-10 sec  | Big Data/Analytics   | PAINT-LINE-3   |

## üî¨ Realistic Industrial Metrics

This simulator aims to generate data reflecting real-world industrial conditions. The following sensor configurations provide a baseline.

#### 1. **VibrationSensor** (Predictive Maintenance)

* **Reference Standard:** Based on principles similar to [ISO 10816-3](https://www.iso.org/standard/78311.html) (Vibrations in industrial machinery).
* **Simulated Data Points:**
    ```python
    {
      "x": random.uniform(2.0, 15.0),  # Simulated RMS Velocity [mm/s] or Acceleration [m/s¬≤]
      "fft": [random.random() for _ in range(100)],  # Simulated frequency components
      "metadata": {
         "samples": size//1000  # Abstract representation
      }
    }
    ```
* **Simulator Default Configuration:** Examples use a **2 Hz** reporting frequency with a **"small" (1-10 KB)** payload, including FFT data.
* **Real-World Context:** Industrial predictive maintenance often employs high sampling rates (e.g., kHz range, like 10-20 kHz) to capture detailed vibration signatures for effective FFT analysis, especially for bearing faults. The simulator's 2 Hz default frequency represents a reporting interval for processed data.
* **Simulated Alarm Thresholds (Example logic):**
    * Warning: >8 (unit depends on metric)
    * Critical: >15 (unit depends on metric)

#### 2. **TemperatureSensor** (Thermal Management)

* **Reference Standard:** Relevant to principles in [ISO 13732-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/43558.html) (Thermal contact safety).
* **Simulated Data Points:**
    ```python
    {
      "motor_temp": random.uniform(30.0, 90.0),  # ¬∞C
      "bearing_temp": random.normalvariate(60.0, 5.0),  # ¬∞C
      "trend": [...]  # Simulated recent data points
    }
    ```
* **Simulator Default Configuration:** Implied frequencies range from **0.1 Hz (10s interval) to 2 Hz (0.5s interval)**.
* **Real-World Context:** Temperature reporting intervals vary by application, from seconds for critical processes to minutes for general monitoring. The simulator‚Äôs configuration is plausible and can be customized to reflect specific thermal dynamics.
* **Simulated Critical Thresholds (Example logic):**
    * Motor: >85¬∞C
    * Bearings: >70¬∞C

#### 3. **QualitySensor** (Quality Control 4.0)

* **AI-driven Metrics Concept:** Simulates output from an AI-based quality control system.
* **Simulated Data Points:**
    ```python
    {
      "defect_count": random.randint(0, 5),
      "image_meta": {
         "size_kb": target_size//1024,
         "defect_coordinates": [...],
         "image_hash": "..."  # Simulated hash/identifier
      }
    }
    ```
* **Simulator Default Configuration:** Examples use a **0.1 Hz (10s interval)** frequency with a **"large" (100 KB - 1 MB)** payload.
* **Real-World Context:** Visual inspection data volumes vary, and edge processing is used to reduce transmitted data. The simulator's configuration abstracts detailed image analysis by using a large payload for a processed "image hash."
* **Simulated Alert (Example logic):** More than 3 defects per batch triggers an alert.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization in Kathar√° Environment

### üîß Customizing Sensor Parameters
1.  Modify the desired JSON configuration file (e.g., `src/publisher1/line1.json`) within your project directory. Change intervals, payload sizes, or QoS levels.
2.  Rebuild the specific Docker image if required (often JSON changes do not require a rebuild if mounted correctly, but check your `.startup` and `lab.conf`). If unsure, rebuild:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f src/compose.yml build publisher1  # Or the specific service
    ```
3.  Restart the Kathar√° lab:
    ```bash
    sudo kathara lclean  # Stop the currently running lab
    sudo kathara lstart
    ```

### üè≠ Adding a New Production Line (e.g., Line 4)
1.  **Create Source Files:** Duplicate an existing publisher directory (e.g., copy `src/publisher1` to `src/publisher4`).
2.  **Configure Line 4:** Create/modify `src/publisher4/line4.json` with the desired `line_id` and sensor configuration.
3.  **Update Docker Build:** Add a service definition for `production-line-4` in `src/compose.yml` pointing to the `src/publisher4` directory and its Dockerfile.
4.  **Update Kathar√° Config:**
    - Add the new device (e.g., `p4`) to `lab.conf`, connecting it to the appropriate network(s).
    - Specify the Docker image to use for `p4` (e.g., `your_dockerhub_user/Kathara-iiot-p4:latest` or the locally built image name).
    - Create a `p4.startup` script to launch the application inside the container.
5.  **Build the New Image:**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f src/compose.yml build production-line-4  # Use the service name from compose.yml
    ```
6.  **Launch the Updated Lab:**
    ```bash
    sudo kathara lstart
    ```

### Other Modifications
* **Custom Alert Rules:** Modify `src/control-center/main.py` and rebuild/restart `cc`.
* **New Sensor Types:** Create new Python classes in `src/publisherX/sensors/`, register them, update JSON configs, rebuild images, and restart the lab.
* **Network Topology:** Modify `lab.conf` to change connections, add routers, or introduce network impairments (using Kathar√°'s advanced features).
